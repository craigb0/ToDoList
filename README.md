# ToDoList

Here are the requirements:

Use React.js to build the application. Use an API of your choice (such as JSONPlaceholder) to manage the list of items. Display a list of items fetched from the API, including their completion status. Allow the user to add a new item to the list by submitting a form. Allow the user to edit an item by clicking on it and updating its fields in a form. Allow the user to delete an item from the list. Use proper error handling and display error messages to the user when appropriate.

Here are some tips to get started:

Use a library such as Axios to make HTTP requests to the API. Use React's state and props to manage the data and pass it between components. Think about how you want to structure your components and what props they will need. You might have a "List" component that renders the individual "Item" components, for example. Use event handlers to handle user interactions, such as clicking a button to delete an item or submitting a form to add or edit an item. Use conditional rendering to display different components or messages based on the state of the application. Use loading indicators to inform the user when the application is fetching data from the API. Display the list of items, including their completion status.

Added Functionality:
General updates to the app, added reminder functionality for the To-do list items, shows notifications on the scheduled reminder time
